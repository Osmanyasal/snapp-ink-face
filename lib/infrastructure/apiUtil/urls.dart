***** Rules *****

* Call REGISTER HTTP POST services ONLY when you select a photo from the library !
* Call /register?id= if you select at the beginning, call /register/target?id= if you select from the filters (by selecting add icon)

* Call filter services to apply a filter onto images registered. Use http get http://192.168.1.23:18080/filters/<file_name>?id=
* <filter_name> is the file name of the images under /assets/images/filters/ or /assets/images/ai_filters/
* if file name contains '-' character, replace that in the url to '/'
    * so if file name is vintage-old1n.png, url: http get http://192.168.1.23:18080/filters/vintage/old1?id=
    * a file name grayscale would be normal like url: http get http://192.168.1.23:18080/filters/grayscale?id=

* call terminate-session http get service when app is closed.

* In all requests, send "id" as a query param! "id" is an unique identifier it is implemented in the app already use that.
* In all requests, send "apiKey" as a header param!
* Image is sent as-is in binary "we used postman to test out api and selected image under /body/binary/
